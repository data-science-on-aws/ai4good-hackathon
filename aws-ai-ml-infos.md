# Deep Learning Stack
 
Sagemaker Python SDK is a higher level python interface to Sagemaker which is a really convenient way to orchestrate training and inference. Of interest to you, may be:
TensorFlow Estimators
Pytorch estimators
Bring your own docker containers
 
 
The Sagemaker Examples Repository has a variety of examples that could be of interest:
Hyperparameter Tuning with Tensor Flow
Using Sagemaker Debugger with a Custom Pytorch Container
 
Also of interest may be:
Hyperparameter Tuning – Search for optimal parameter settings (in parallel)
Sagemaker Debugger – Detect issues, e.g., with vanishing gradients
Experiments—to track different training/tuning jobs
Managed Spot Training – to save costs during training
 
# Vision Stack 
 
Frameworks Layer: Sagemaker Python SDK is a higher level python interface to Sagemaker which is a really convenient way to orchestrate training and inference. The Sagemaker Examples Repository has a variety of examples that could be of interest:
Hyperparameter Tuning with Tensor Flow
Using Sagemaker Debugger with a Custom Pytorch Container
 
ML Services: Sagemaker has built-in algorithms for object detection and semantic segmentation. Sagemaker Ground Truthenables a combination of labeling/annotation workflows with active learning.  Examples demonstrating all these features can be found in the Sagemaker examples repository.
 
AI Services: Rekognition supports a variety of use cases related to image and video including object detection, face and celebrity recognition, and content moderation. For cases where you need domain-specific object labels (e.g., road signs, company logs), we offer Rekognition Custom Labels where you can upload training data to customize the detected objects.
Textract enables high-accuracy text extraction/OCR from images (PDF, JPEG etc)
 
# Partnerships: 
**AWS Data Exchange** provides startups a way to monetize the expensive datasets that need to be created for visionuse cases.
