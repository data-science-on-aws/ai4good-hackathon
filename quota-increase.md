# How to increase your AWS Service Quotas for Amazon SageMaker

Your AWS account has default quotas, formerly referred to as limits, for each AWS service. 
Unless otherwise noted, each quota is Region-specific. 

## The default service quotas for Amazon SageMaker are listed [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sagemaker.html#limits_sagemaker).

Please note that the service quotas may vary between different Amazon SageMaker services as described in the link shared above:

- Amazon SageMaker Notebooks
- Amazon SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning
- Amazon SageMaker Processing
- Amazon SageMaker Training and Managed Spot Training
- Amazon SageMaker Hosting
- Amazon SageMaker Batch Transform
- Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth

For model training you should look at the quota for **Amazon SageMaker Training and Managed Spot Training**.
